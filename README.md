# Fire Station Location Optimization

This project addresses the classic **Fire Station Location Problem** — determining the optimal placement of fire stations in a given area to ensure efficient coverage and minimal response times to emergencies.

## 🚒 Problem Statement

The goal is to select locations for a limited number of fire stations so that every demand point (e.g., neighborhoods or buildings) is within a specified distance (or response time) from at least one fire station. The optimization minimizes either the total distance, the number of uncovered points, or the average/max response time.

This is a real-world application of location optimization in emergency services and urban planning.

## 📊 Methods Used

- Greedy algorithms
- Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
- Graph-based models
- Heuristic search
- Coverage models (Maximal Covering Location Problem - MCLP)

## 🗺️ Features

- Input: Customizable map/grid with demand points and possible fire station locations.
- Output: Optimal or near-optimal locations for stations.
- Visualization of coverage and results (optional).
- Configurable parameters: number of stations, coverage radius, etc.

# Fire Station Location Optimization

This project addresses the classic **Fire Station Location Problem** â€” determining the optimal placement of fire stations in a given area to ensure efficient coverage and minimal response times to emergencies.

## ðŸš’ Problem Statement

The goal is to select locations for a limited number of fire stations so that every demand point (e.g., neighborhoods or buildings) is within a specified distance (or response time) from at least one fire station. The optimization minimizes either the total distance, the number of uncovered points, or the average/max response time.
